    <p>
        To your soul <br>
        To your soul <br>
        Cry <br>
        Cry <br>
        Cry <br>
        You leave in the morning with everything you own in a little black case <br>
        Alone on a platform, the wind and the rain on a sad and lonely face <br>
        Mother will never understand why you had to leave <br>
        But the answers you seek will never be found at home <br>
        The love that you need will never be found at home <br>
        Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away <br>
        Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away <br>
        Pushed around and kicked around, always a lonely boy <br>
        You were the one that they'd talk about around town as they put you down <br>
        And as hard as they would try they'd hurt to make you cry <br>
        But you never cried to them, just to your soul <br>
        No, you never cried to them, just to your soul <br>
        Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away (crying to your soul) <br>
        Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away (crying to your soul) <br>
        Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away (crying to your soul) <br>
        Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away <br>
        Cry, boy, cry <br>
        Cry, boy, cry <br>
        Cry, boy, cry, boy, cry <br>
        Cry, boy, cry, boy, cry <br>
        Cry, boy, cry, boy, cry <br>
        Cry, boy, cry, boy, cry <br>
        Cry, boy, cry, boy, cry <br>
        Cry, boy, cry, boy, cry <br>
        You leave in the morning with everything you own in a little black case <br>
        Alone on a platform, the wind and the rain on a sad and lonely face <br>
        Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away <br>
        Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away <br>
        Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away <br>
        Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away <br>
        Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away <br>
        Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away</p>
