        To your soul
        To your soul
        Cry
        Cry
        Cry
        You leave in the morning with everything you own in a little black case
        Alone on a platform, the wind and the rain on a sad and lonely face
        Mother will never understand why you had to leave
        But the answers you seek will never be found at home
        The love that you need will never be found at home
        Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
        Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
        Pushed around and kicked around, always a lonely boy
        You were the one that they'd talk about around town as they put you down
        And as hard as they would try they'd hurt to make you cry
        But you never cried to them, just to your soul
        No, you never cried to them, just to your soul
        Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away (crying to your soul)
        Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away (crying to your soul)
        Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away (crying to your soul)
        Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
        Cry, boy, cry
        Cry, boy, cry
        Cry, boy, cry, boy, cry
        Cry, boy, cry, boy, cry
        Cry, boy, cry, boy, cry
        Cry, boy, cry, boy, cry
        Cry, boy, cry, boy, cry
        Cry, boy, cry, boy, cry
        You leave in the morning with everything you own in a little black case
        Alone on a platform, the wind and the rain on a sad and lonely face
        Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
        Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
        Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
        Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
        Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
        Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away</pre>
